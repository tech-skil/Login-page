# React App Deployment to GitHub Pages

This repository contains the source code for a React app that can be easily deployed to GitHub Pages. Follow the steps below to build and deploy the app seamlessly.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Build the React App

In your Visual Studio Code terminal, execute the following command to build the React app:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Step 2: Configure `package.json`

Open the `package.json` file and include a "homepage" field. Replace "username" with your GitHub username and "my-app" with your repository name:

```json
"homepage": "https://username.github.io/my-app",
```

### Step 3: Update Deployment Scripts

Add the deployment scripts to your `package.json` file under the "scripts" section:

```json
"scripts": {
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
  // additional scripts...
}
```

### Step 4: Run the `gh-pages` Command

Deploy your app to GitHub Pages using the following command:

```bash
npx gh-pages -d build
```

### Step 5: Set Git Remote Origin

Ensure your Git repository has the correct remote origin. If not, add it using:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/my-app.git
```

### Step 6: Execute Deployment Code

Run the deployment script:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

## Additional Notes

### Reinstall Node Modules

If necessary, reinstall the node modules by running:

```bash
npm install
```

By following these steps, your React app will be successfully deployed to GitHub Pages. Remember to replace "username" and "my-app" with your GitHub details.

Feel free to explore and customize the content to suit your specific app and requirements.
